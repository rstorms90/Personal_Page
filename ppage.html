My brother and some family used to be in Colorado, and every time I would visit I would long for the next time to see the peaks. I moved here three years ago to climb and snowboard the mountains! Apart from climbing and snowboarding, I love to train jiu jitsu here in Boulder, write, and tinker with technology.</h4>
